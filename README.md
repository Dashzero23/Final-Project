Theme "nearby in space, but distant in time" explaination: In a casino setting, control a poker cheater as they evade pursuing cops, surviving for 60 seconds in a race against time, emphasizing the tension between the confined space and the temporal time challenge.

Core Requirement:
- [project archive]: this GitHub
- [source code]: code files in this GitHub
- [mobile]: this game is mobile compatible with D-Pad to control as well as screen auto-optimized based on screen size of any device
- [self-teaching]: this game has visual instruction for gameplay as well as recommendation that mobile device should be horizontal when playing
- [persistent music toggle]: there is a music button at the menu screen which can turn on/off bgm and still have sfx on
- [completability]: Core gameplay can be reached as soon as the player press Play on the menu and the game can be finished within 1 minute if the player is skilled enough (which we are not and are considering nerfting the enemy)  

Selectable Requirements:
- Advanced visual asset: there is a 3D mesh animation done in blender as the intro
- Procedural graphics: there are rectangles serve as back buttons for the Credit as well as the endings
- Complete closed captioning: the bgm is displayed with "bgm is playing" and card sfx is displayed with "card hit"
